# Calculator
A calculator with basic arithmetic functionality. The purpose of this project was to create an app with basic functionality and
attempt to split JavaScript code in to functions according to what the user was trying to do(function).  One of the the main
objectives was to ensure proper user input; for example restricting the user from entering multiple decimal points which could 
cause errors. Another important objective was to ensure text inside screen would adjust were the user to input a really long number.

## Usage
The calculator currently only accepts mouse clicks for input; the user cannot use the keyboard for input.
User can perform basic arithmetic operations by clicking on either of these buttons "+, -, *, /".

## Technologies
HTML
CSS
JavaScript

## Project Status
This was a beginner project and the main functionalities have been complete. An aspect of the program that could cause problems is
that the user is not restricted in how long a number they can input.  A restriction needs to be implemented to insure that the user
is not able to enter numbers that JavaScript cannot accurately represent.
